## Learn more

This library was designed to support libraries and episodes produced for [Point-Free][point-free], a
video series exploring the Swift programming language hosted by [Brandon Williams][mbrandonw] and
[Stephen Celis][stephencelis].

You can watch all of the episodes [here](https://www.pointfree.co/collections/concurrency).

## Motivation

This library comes with a number of tools that make working with Swift concurrency easier and more
testable.

  * [`ActorIsolated` and `LockIsolated`](#actorisolated-and-lockisolated)
  * [Streams](#streams)
  * [Tasks](#tasks)
  * [`UncheckedSendable`](#uncheckedsendable)
  * [Serial execution](#serial-execution)

### `ActorIsolated` and `LockIsolated`

The `ActorIsolated` and `LockIsolated` types help wrap other values in an isolated context.
`ActorIsolated` wraps the value in an actor so that the only way to access and mutate the value is
through an async/await interface. `LockIsolated` wraps the value in a class with a lock, which
allows you to read and write the value with a synchronous interface. You should prefer to use
`ActorIsolated` when you have access to an asynchronous context.

### Streams

The library comes with numerous helper APIs spread across the two Swift stream types:

  * There are helpers that erase any `AsyncSequence` conformance to either concrete stream type.
    This allows you to treat the stream type as a kind of "type erased" `AsyncSequence`.

    For example, suppose you have a dependency client like this:

    ```swift
    struct ScreenshotsClient {
      var screenshots: () -> AsyncStream<Void>
    }
    ```

    Then you can construct a live implementation that "erases" the
    `NotificationCenter.Notifications` async sequence to a stream:

    ```swift
    extension ScreenshotsClient {
      static let live = Self(
        screenshots: {
          NotificationCenter.default
            .notifications(named: UIApplication.userDidTakeScreenshotNotification)
            .map { _ in }
            .eraseToStream()  // ⬅️
        }
      )
    }
    ```

    Use `eraseToThrowingStream()` to propagate failures from throwing async sequences.

  * Swift 5.9's `makeStream(of:)` functions have been back-ported. It can handy in tests that need
    to override a dependency endpoint that returns a stream:

    ```swift
    let screenshots = AsyncStream.makeStream(of: Void.self)

    let model = FeatureModel(screenshots: { screenshots.stream })

    XCTAssertEqual(model.screenshotCount, 0)
    screenshots.continuation.yield()  // Simulate a screenshot being taken.
    XCTAssertEqual(model.screenshotCount, 1)
    ```

  * Static `AsyncStream.never` and `AsyncThrowingStream.never` helpers are provided that represent
    streams that live forever and never emit. They can be handy in tests that need to override a
    dependency endpoint with a stream that should suspend and never emit for the duration of the
    test.

    ```swift
    let model = FeatureModel(screenshots: { .never })
    ```

  * Static `AsyncStream.finished` and `AsyncThrowingStream.finished(throwing:)` helpers are provided
    that represents streams that complete immediately without emitting. They can be handy in tests
    that need to override a dependency endpoint with a stream that completes/fails immediately.

### Tasks

The library enhances the `Task` type with new functionality.

  * The static function `Task.never()` can asynchronously return a value of any type, but does so by
    suspending forever. This can be useful for satisfying a dependency requirement in a way that
    does not require you to actually return data from that endpoint.

    For example, suppose you have a dependency client like this:

    ```swift
    struct SettingsClient {
      var fetchSettings: () async throws -> Settings
    }
    ```

    You can override the client's `fetchSettings` endpoint in tests to suspend forever by awaiting
    `Task.never()`:

    ```swift
    SettingsClient(
      fetchSettings: { try await Task.never() }
    )
    ```

  * `Task.cancellableValue` is a property that awaits the unstructured task's `value` property while
    propagating cancellation from the current async context.

  * `Task.megaYield()` is a blunt tool that can make flakey async tests a little less flakey by
    suspending the current task a number of times and improve the odds that other async work has
    enough time to start. Prefer the reliability of [serial execution](#serial-execution) instead
    where possible.

### `UncheckedSendable`

A wrapper type that can make any type `Sendable`, but in an unsafe and unchecked way. This type
should only be used as an alternative to `@preconcurrency import`, which turns off concurrency
checks for everything in the library. Whereas `UncheckedSendable` allows you to turn off concurrency
warnings for just one single usage of a particular type.

While [SE-0302][se-0302] mentions future work of ["Adaptor Types for Legacy
Codebases"][se-0302-unsafetransfer], including an `UnsafeTransfer` type that serves the same
purpose, it has not landed in Swift.

### Serial execution

Some asynchronous code is [notoriously difficult][reliably-testing-swift-concurrency] to test in
Swift due to how suspension points are processed by the runtime. The library comes with a static
function, `withMainSerialExecutor`, that attempts to run all tasks spawned in an operation serially
and deterministically. This function can be used to make asynchronous tests faster and less flakey.

> **Warning**: This API is only intended to be used from tests to make them more reliable. Please do
> not use it from application code.
>
> We say that it "_attempts_ to run all tasks spawned in an operation serially and
> deterministically" because under the hood it relies on a global, mutable variable in the Swift
> runtime to do its job, and there are no scoping _guarantees_ should this mutable variable change
> during the operation.

For example, consider the following seemingly simple model that makes a network request and manages
so `isLoading` state while the request is inflight:

```swift
@Observable
class NumberFactModel {
  var fact: String?
  var isLoading = false
  var number = 0

  // Inject the request dependency explicitly to make it testable, but can also
  // be provided via a dependency management library.
  let getFact: (Int) async throws -> String

  func getFactButtonTapped() async {
    self.isLoading = true
    defer { self.isLoading = false }
    do {
      self.fact = try await self.getFact(self.number)
    } catch {
      // TODO: Handle error
    }
  }
}
```

We would love to be able to write a test that allows us to confirm that the `isLoading` state
flips to `true` and then `false`. You might hope that it is as easy as this:

```swift
func testIsLoading() async {
  let model = NumberFactModel(getFact: { "\($0) is a good number" })

  let task = Task { await model.getFactButtonTapped() }
  XCTAssertEqual(model.isLoading, true)
  XCTAssertEqual(model.fact, nil)

  await task.value
  XCTAssertEqual(model.isLoading, false)
  XCTAssertEqual(model.fact, "0 is a good number.")
}
```

However this fails almost 100% of the time. The problem is that the line immediately after creating
the unstructured `Task` executes before the line _inside_ the unstructured task, and so we never
detect the moment the `isLoading` state flips to `true`.

You might hope you can wiggle yourself in between the moment the `getFactButtonTapped` method is
called and the moment the request finishes by using a `Task.yield`:

```diff
 func testIsLoading() async {
   let model = NumberFactModel(getFact: { "\($0) is a good number" })

   let task = Task { await model.getFactButtonTapped() }
+  await Task.yield()
   XCTAssertEqual(model.isLoading, true)
   XCTAssertEqual(model.fact, nil)

   await task.value
   XCTAssertEqual(model.isLoading, false)
   XCTAssertEqual(model.fact, "0 is a good number.")
 }
```

But that still fails the vast majority of times.

These problems, and more, can be fixed by running this entire test on the main serial executor:

```diff
 func testIsLoading() async {
+  await withMainSerialExecutor {
     let model = NumberFactModel(getFact: { "\($0) is a good number" })

     let task = Task { await model.getFactButtonTapped() }
     await Task.yield()
     XCTAssertEqual(model.isLoading, true)
     XCTAssertEqual(model.fact, nil)

     await task.value
     XCTAssertEqual(model.isLoading, false)
     XCTAssertEqual(model.fact, "0 is a good number.")
+  }
 }
```

That one change makes this test pass deterministically, 100% of the time.
